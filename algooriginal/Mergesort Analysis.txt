Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm based on a divide and conquer algorithmic design pattern. 
The best way to illustrate the mechanics merge sort is to divide the algorithms steps into the subsections. 
The first section is the divide section where the algorithm receives the array input and makes one of the following two choices. 
If the array size is 0 or 1 we return the element as it is already sorted, if not we divide the input array into half (n/2). 
We then apply our second step which is to recursively reduce our problem into smaller and smaller sub problems 
until we can solve each sub problem in this case repeatedly split the array into smaller and smaller sub arrays
until we can sort each subarray.  
Our final step is to merge/conquer step where we merge each of the sorted sub arrays together into a bigger array 
which contains all of the elements in sorted order.
