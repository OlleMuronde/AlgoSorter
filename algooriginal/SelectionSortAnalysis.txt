The idea of selection sort is rather simple: we repeatedly find the next largest (or smallest) element in the array and move it to its final position in the sorted array. 
Assume that we wish to sort the array in increasing order, i.e. the smallest element at the beginning of the array and the largest element at the end. 
We begin by selecting the largest element and moving it to the highest index position. 
We can do this by swapping the element at the highest index and the largest element. 
We then reduce the effective size of the array by one element and repeat the process on the smaller (sub)array. 
The process stops when the effective size of the array becomes 1 (an array of 1 element is already sorted).
